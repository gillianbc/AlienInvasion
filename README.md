# Alien Invasion

A little space invaders game which is a learning exercise from the book Python Crash Course

This is my first venture into Python.  I'm not much interested in visual exercises, but I need to get some projects under my belt to get used to the syntax.

To run the game:

> python3 alien_invasion.py

I haven't bothered with the last few exercises such as game speeding up, points increasing with faster game, rounding scores, high score table
